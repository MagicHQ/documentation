# üöÄ Get Started

## üèóÔ∏è Get Template Code

Let's get started by building a simple interface to let users log in or log out via an email magic link experience. We've created a template with necessary html and styles on CodeSandBox. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**üëâ Go to our** [**Hello World Template**](https://go.magic.link/hello-world-template) **to continue this tutorial!**
{% endhint %}

_If you don't want to go through the walkthrough,_ ****_feel free to skip to the_ [_completed implementation_](https://go.magic.link/hello-world-code) _or watch the demo video below._

## üó∫Ô∏è Walkthrough

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Magic SDK

Install Magic SDK to your template by simply including a script tag after the comment line in the CodeSandBox editor. You can start by copy and pasting the code snippet below to your editor under the comment.

```markup
<!-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Magic SDK -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/magic-sdk/dist/magic.js"></script>
```

_See other ways to_ [_install Magic SDK_](client-sdk/browser-js/get-started.md) _such as using yarn or npm._

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Magic Instance

You can initialize a Magic instance with your Publishable API Key with the following code. Copy and paste this code snippet below to your editor under the comment.

```javascript
/* 2Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Magic Instance */
const magic = new Magic("YOUR_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY");
```

You need to sign up or log in to the [**Magic Dashboard**](https://dashboard.magic.link/) to view your API keys. Once you are logged in, you can then update the `'YOUR_TEST_PUBLISHABLE_API_KEY'` string to your actual test _publishable_ API key, which looks something like `pk_test_*********`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Render Function

Next, to complete the setup, let's write the logic on what the Hello World app should display when **\(1\) users are not logged in**, and when **\(2\) users are logged in**. Copy and paste this code snippet below to your editor under the comment.

```javascript
/* 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Render Function */
const render = async () => {
  const isLoggedIn = await magic.user.isLoggedIn();
  /* Show login form if user is not logged in */
  let html = `
    <h1>Please sign up or login</h1>
    <form onsubmit="handleLogin(event)">
      <input type="email" name="email" required="required" placeholder="Enter your email" />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  `;
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    /* Get user metadata including email */
    const userMetadata = await magic.user.getMetadata();
    html = `
      <h1>Current user: ${userMetadata.email}</h1>
      <button onclick="handleLogout()">Logout</button>
    `;
  }
  document.getElementById("app").innerHTML = html;
};
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Login Handler

Now the real fun begins! Check out how you can implement user login with **a single line of code**, without needing to write any backend code! Copy and paste this code snippet below to your editor under the comment.

```javascript
/* 4Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Login Handler */
const handleLogin = async e => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const email = new FormData(e.target).get("email");
  if (email) {
    /* One-liner login ü§Ø */
    await magic.auth.loginWithMagicLink({ email });
    render();
  }
};
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Logout Handler

To wrap it all up, it's super easy to implement user logout as well. Copy and paste this code snippet below to your editor under the comment.

```javascript
/* 5Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Logout Handler */
const handleLogout = async () => {
  await magic.user.logout();
  render();
};
```

üéâ **Congratulations!** Now that you've completed the walkthrough, you should have a working version of the Hello World app! Don't worry if things are not working for some reason - you can find the [completed working version](https://go.magic.link/hello-world-code) on CodeSandBox.

## üëâ What's Next

Now that you have an understanding of how Magic works on the client-side, we _strongly recommend_ you to take a look at an end-to-end, full-stack example to learn about how to connect it to a Node.js backend server and see the full potential of Magic!

Did you know you can actually customize the login experience \(using your own UI instead of the default\) and also have a branded magic link email? You can learn how to do that with the link below!

## ðŸš€ Welcome to the Magic Browser JS SDK

The Magic client-side JavaScript SDK is your entry-point to secure, passwordless authentication for your web-based app. This guide will cover some important topics for getting started with client-side APIs and to make the most of Magic's features.

**ðŸ‘‰ Go to our** [**Getting Started**](get-started.md) **tutorial to begin your integration**

**ðŸ‘‰ Visit the** [**API documentation**](sdk/) **to learn the methods you'll be using**

**ðŸ‘‰ Go to** [**Examples**](examples/) **for an introduction to common patterns and use-cases**

{% hint style="info" %}
Magic can support both server-based or serverless web applications. It is up to the developers to implement the [Admin SDK](../../admin-sdk/node-js/) to validate the DID Token.

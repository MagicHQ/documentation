# React Native

## ðŸš€ Welcome to the Magic React Native JS SDK

The Magic **React Native** JavaScript SDK is distributed **from the same NPM package as our**[ **Browser JavaScript SDK**](../browser-js/)**!** This is your entry-point to secure, passwordless authentication for your iOS or Android-based React Native app. This guide will cover some important topics for getting started with client-side APIs and to make the most of Magic's features.

**ðŸ‘‰ Go to our** [**Getting Started**](get-started.md) **tutorial to begin your integration**

{% hint style="info" %}
Magic can support both server-based or serverless web applications. It is up to the developers to implement the [Admin SDK](../../admin-sdk/node-js/) to validate the DID Token.
{% endhint %}

### Looking for a server-side API? Start with one of these:
